With this Java class you can simply call dot from your Java programs.
It is made to facilitate the usage of [GraphViz](http://www.graphviz.org/)
in your Java programs.

Example
-------
Check out the file `Proba.java` to see how to use this simple API.

How to compile the sources in command-line
------------------------------------------
You can use maven. The output will appear in the `target/` folder.

    $ mvn package

Or, you can use SCons. The output will appear in the `bin/` folder.

    $ scons

How to launch the example from command-line
-------------------------------------------
If you used SCons for instance, then

    $ java -cp bin/ com/github/jabbalaci/graphviz/Proba

It prints a dot source to the stdout, and creates its corresponding GIF
representation in your temp folder.
